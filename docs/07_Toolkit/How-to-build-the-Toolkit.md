title: How to build the Toolkit
---

This helps you to build the latest version of the Gephi Toolkit from the source code. If you just want to use a toolkit release, you can download it [here](http://gephi.org/toolkit/).

The Gephi Toolkit is based on exactly the same source code as Gephi is, it is just a different way to select and packages modules.

## Build Toolkit

Check build instructions in the toolkit repository README https://github.com/gephi/gephi-toolkit
