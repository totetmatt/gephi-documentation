Gephi has a localization program to provide the software in your language: this page describes how to contribute! We use the [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/gephi/).

## Short and long term team goal

Lots of people are not comfortable with English. Our goal is to distribute Gephi in French, Spanish and other languages the community requests.

## Translation guide

**Important Note: only English texts should be written directly in the source code .properties files. All translations should be made on Weblate platform, otherwise there will be conflicts.**
